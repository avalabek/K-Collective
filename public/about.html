            <p class="light" id="welcomestatement">We know that community happens around the table. We talk, we share stories, we learn. However, we don’t take into account the community that can happen one step before sitting down at a table – the preparation and cook time. The kitchen is a place of life, a place of sharing and nourishment. As we share stories and experiences, we begin to build bridges of friendship and understanding. The Kitchen Collective exists to bring neighbors together to learn from and about one another with the purpose of building a community. We build community by having conversations around a table and together contributing to the needs in our community. The time spent preparing and cooking is not the end, it is the means in which connections are made, the bridges are built, and the web of community is woven in order that together we can see the flourishing of our neighborhoods. 

              <br><br><br>

 

            Each month we gather in a home to cook a type of international food. Along with a chosen ethnic cuisine, a local non-profit is chosen that will be highlighted and funds contributed.  An instructor with knowledge of that ethnic cuisine decides on the menu for that specific day, typically an appetizer and main course. The Cooking Collective provides all the ingredients, nametags, place settings, aprons, etc.

            <br><br><br>

 

            We invite you to spend 2 hours with us in the kitchen: learning, preparing and cooking; and then we will gather around the table and enjoy the fruits of our labor.

            <br><br><br>

             

            The cost for the event is $30/person. 25% of this will be donated to the charity of the choice of the host. You are welcome to donate extra to the charity if you wish.
